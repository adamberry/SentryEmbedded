# Sentry Embedded
Sentry is a Bluetooth controlled lock system utilizing Bluetooth to trigger a linear actuator via a TI MSP430 micro-controller. This repository contains the source code for the embedded systems portion of this project. This code is meant to be run on an MSP-430 microcontroller. Note that the embedded systems portion of the code would work just fine with Android, iOS, or IoT devices and does not need to be paired with the Android repository.

The website is currently hosted [here](http://eet.etec.wwu.edu/berryha/).
